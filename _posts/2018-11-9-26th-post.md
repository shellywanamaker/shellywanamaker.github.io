## Geoduck Broodstock experiment

### Supplies for Pt. Whitney

- -20C mini freezer:  Steven's going to try to pick one up this weekend, or I'll order one next week if not in stores.

- Ordered [probe clips](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01HOERFO8/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and [hanging hooks](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00WSO08T4/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) from amazon to try to fix probes in tanks. I plan to mount the clips and hang the clip mount by zipties from the hanging hooks. We'll see if it works.

### Water chemistry
- Apex and cameras have been offline since yesterday morning. Matt said their internet plan got canceled possibly because a bill didn't get paid, but he will let us know when it's back up. 
- We talked about setting up an independent modem to run the Apex systems on, and to also set the router up to auto-reset every day so we don't have outages that could interrupt the treatment or data collection. 
- Here's the [Apex data from Oct. 26-Nov 7](https://github.com/shellywanamaker/P_generosa/blob/master/Water_Chemistry/Apex_data_20181026-20181107.csv) and [plots of the pH and temp over time](https://github.com/shellywanamaker/P_generosa/blob/master/Water_Chemistry/Apex_Water_Chem_Oct-Nov_2018.md). 
	- it's not convincing that the treatments still run when the internet is down so we will test this on Monday.

### Reproductive Maturation Assay development

- Grace shared [some info](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/476) about tissue samples for RNA extraction and qPCR
	- need to select samples based on development stage
	- need to design primers for VTG and b-actin
	- need to find the qPCR protocol and make sure we have all the reagents

### Repeated hemolymph sampling:  geoduck status @ SAFS 
@12pm
- Ducks look alive and OK

Added 5mL [Shellfish diet](https://reedmariculture.com/product_instant_algae_shellfish_diet_1800.php) and mixed with air stone

- [Feeding recommendations](https://reedmariculture.com/support_feeding_shellfish.php): 
	Shellfish Diet feed per day (ml) = grams of broodstock meat (WET weight) x 0.036
	* probably could feed them a little more; ordered shellfish diet today
