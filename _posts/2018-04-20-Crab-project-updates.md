### RNA Isolation
I isolated RNA from the warm crab sample tubes today!

For tube 299, there was no visible hemolymph when I initially removed it from the freezer:

Usually, I can see the hemolymph as an white-ish opaque clump at the bottom of the tube. 

### DecaPod
S1E5 is up: [Crab meeting #2](https://bittercrab.wordpress.com/2018/04/20/decapod-s1e5-crab-meeting-2/)

### Weekend/next week
I REALLY need to get more organized with my spreadsheets. I have a bunch of separate Qubit results spreadsheets, several large data sheets to do with crabs (morph spreadsheet; sampling spreadsheet; RNA isolation spreadsheet) that all need to be combined into one GIANT masterspreadsheet. I need to avoid copy and paste, but use what Pam showed me a couple weeks ago. I can't quite remember how to do it, but I recorded her explanation, so hopefully listening to it will help!
