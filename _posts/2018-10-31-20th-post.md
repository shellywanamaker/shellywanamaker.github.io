## Developing  assay for VTG detection

- Met with Jose (he has experience with developing Vitellogenin ELISA assays in fish)  
  	- Options we discussed:  
		- ELISA: quantitative  
		- Western Blot: not quantitative  
		- qPCR: quantitative  
		- Calcium assay; calcium correlated with vitellogenin (vitellogenin binds Ca2+)  
		- assay for Upstream vitellogenesis inducer? (i.e. estradiol, although Brent says Geoducks likely don't have this)  
	
	- To develop ELISA:  
		- need   
			1) isolated vitellogenin to generate standard curve and generate antibody  
			- can isolate vitellogenin by:  
				- fractionation? It's large  
				- inducing expression  
				- cloning and doing bacterial expression  
			2) antibody   
			- can generate antibody by sending protein (or protein fragment) to commercial antibody lab (they inject rabbits)  

	- To develop Western:  
		- only need antibody  
	- [Calcium assay](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/sigma/mak022?lang=en&region=US)  

	- To develop qPCR:  
		- need primers  
		- need sequence  
			- VTG superfamily domain?  
				-Align protein sequence to Pgenr genome (tblastn)  
					- tblastn web interface finds  
				-revtrans on serial cloer to get DNA sequence?  
					-tried this and BLASTn web interface finds nothing significant  
			- BLAST to Geoduck genome  
				- build BLAST index out of Geoduck genome  
				- align VTG superfamily domain to genome  
				- align protein to genome  
		- [samples](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Qsvz3QTURlPF_hX05BQxjom3484WuMfqQ1ILl9LEljU/edit#gid=2006985773)  
			- no template  
			- non-DNase treated sample or gDNA prep?  
			- RNApreps  
				- hemocytes from different stages  
					- immature  
					- early female  
					- middle female  
					- late female  
					- post spawn female  
					- male  
				- gonad tissue from different stages  
					- immature  
					- early  
					- middle  
					- late  
					- post spawn  
				- hepatopancreas  
					- immature  
					- early  
					- middle  
					- late  
					- post spawn
