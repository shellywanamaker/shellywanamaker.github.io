title: Oly gonad & larvae RNA isolation 
---

### Gonad RNA isolation: 

Olympia oyster gonad samples were fixed in PAXgene tissue fixative/stabilizer in April, 2017, directly after removing them from pH treatments (~7.2, ~7.8 for 8wks; prior to the pH treatments animals had been in temperature treatments, 6C & 10C for 8wks).  Sam previously extracted RNA from 12 of my gonad samples, 6 of which were from the South Sound F1 groups. Today, I extracted (most of) the remaining South Sound gonad samples.

First, I used a razor blade to dig tissue out of the paraffin blocks, using the corresponding slides to identify and target only gonad area for my tissue sections. 

For RNA extraction, I used the same kit - [PAXgene fixed tissue RNA kit](https://github.com/laurahspencer/O.lurida_Stress/blob/master/References/PAXgene-Tissue-RNA-Kit-Handbok.pdf), following the instructions for for tissue in histology blocks.  I followed the kit procedure, with the following alterations:  
  * To homogenize: Added 1 spoonful of glass beads (autoclaved) to each sample, and vortexed for ~45 minutes on the vortexer speed 9 with the foam tube holder attachment.  At minute ~25, moved samples from the inside ring to the outside ring.  
  * Max centrifuge speed for steps 4, 7 & 12 = 13rpm
  * Max centrifuge speed for steps 22-24 = 15rpm 
  * Final elution volumes:  1st elution of 20ul, 2nd with 30ul, for total volume ~48-50ul (kit says I will lose ~2ul to the column).  
  * I began extracting 30 samples, but then found that I only had 26 columns, so I terminated 4 samples, one from each treatment.  
  * Sample #23:  I ran out of the DNase + Buffer mixture for this final sample at step 18, I only had ~1/4 of the required mix.  Because I had no more volumes of DNase left, but noticed a few small droplets on the walls of a DNase tube, I added 20ul of buffer to the DNase tube, flicked to mix, then centrifuged for 2 seconds and added that (~20-ish ul) to sample 26.  

Quantified RNA using the [Qubit RNA assay](https://github.com/laurahspencer/O.lurida_Stress/blob/master/References/Qubit_RNA_HS_Assay_UG.pdf) with Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer.  Used 2.0ul of each sample for quantification.  Approximate RNA (ng) is calculated using concentration (ng/ul) in 46ul.
