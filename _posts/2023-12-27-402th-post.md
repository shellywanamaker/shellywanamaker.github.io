**ABSTRACT:**  
Timely detection of harmful microbes is critical to controlling disease spread in agriculture and aquaculture. Standardmolecular diagnostic tests (e.g. PCR) require laboratories and lag in time-to-result leading to delayed action. Alternativemethods like isothermal amplification and CRISPR/Cas detection have high sensitivity and specificity with minimal,inexpensive equipment that can be converted to user-friendly, field-deployable formats. Different than antibody/ELISAbased rapid tests, these methods detect genetic targets which makes them easily adaptable. We developed LAMP +CRISPR diagnostics for DNA and RNA viruses that impact shrimp aquaculture worldwide (White Spot Syndrome Virus(WSSV) and Taura Syndrome Virus). We then adapted the diagnostics to target toxic Pseudo-nitzschia that cause amnesic shellfish poisoning in humans. The assays we developed show similar sensitivity, specificity, and quantificationto real-time PCR. Adapting these technologies for monitoring disease and beyond (e.g. selectively bred tolerant orresistant stocks) will support economic growth by reducing supply loss, increasing productivity and sustainability.
