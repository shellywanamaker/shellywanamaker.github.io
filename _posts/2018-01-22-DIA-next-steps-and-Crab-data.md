Today I heard back from Emma that [my ~35% error rate](http://owl.fish.washington.edu/scaphapoda/grace/2018-01-10_errorchecking.xlsx) is okay, and that there isn't much to be done about it anyway. So now I am clear to move on to the next steps in analyzing the [2015 Oysterseed data](http://owl.fish.washington.edu/scaphapoda/grace/2015Cg.sky.zip). 

I also looked more into the [spreadsheet](http://owl.fish.washington.edu/scaphapoda/grace/011918_NPRB-crab-data.xlsx) that Pam sent us. I think we'll likely be focusing on the tab labeled "3 samples per crab". The Green are the first sample day, pink the second sample day, and yellow are the final sample day. We are going to pool samples. From day 1 (green) we are going to pool five samples from the uninfected and five from the infected (n = 2). From day 2 (pink) we are going to pool five samples from the uninfected and five from the infected at all three of the temperatures (n = 6). From day 3 (yellow) we will do the same as for day 2 (n = 6). So the total number will be 14.

There is data on whether a crab is considered mature or immature and I am unsure if we should take that into account when choosing samples to pool.
