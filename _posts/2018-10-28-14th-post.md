## Methylation analysis:  P. generosa juvenile OA response  
### bismark currently running on full data set  
### mapping and coverage analysis with subsetted samples (10K reads each)  
	
[bismark summary](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shellytrigg/Shelly_Pgenerosa/master/analyses/bismark_summary_report.html)  
		- all samples have > 50% mapping efficiency with Bismark settings --score_min L,0,-1.2 -I 60 --non_directional   
		- deduplication removed very few reads, per usual   
		- % methylation is on average 20%  
	
[methylkit summary](https://github.com/shellytrigg/Shelly_Pgenerosa/blob/master/analyses/MethylKit_JuviPgenr_diffpH/GeoduckSubsetAlignmentTest.md)
		- coverage plots don't appear to obviously show any particular sample or condition should be excluded due to low coverage.this may become more obvious in the full analysis or downstream analysis  
		- the genome region > 60000 seems to have low coverage in all samples

### bismark run completed on mox
	- last part failed because I copied from jupyter notebook and had '!' in the code still
	- need to edit this part for future scripts, but for now i will complete the analysis on ostrich in my jupyter notebook
		- generate summary file
		- generate sorted bam files for methylkit analysis
	- need to rsync everything onto Metacarcinus from Mox gscratch
