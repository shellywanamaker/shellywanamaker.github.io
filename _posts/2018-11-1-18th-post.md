## Methylation analysis: 
### Geoduck alignments too slow, should be directional, and many chromosomal sequence extraction errors


- increase processors/cores to use from default(4) to 28 (i.e. -p 28)

- change to directional mapping because non-directional mapping should be [1:1:1:1](http://seqanswers.com/forums/showthread.php?t=18908) But instead the non-directional mapping shows ~ 10:1:1:10 as follows:  
	CT/GA/CT:       2758    ((converted) top strand)  
	GA/CT/CT:       350     (complementary to (converted) top strand)  
	GA/CT/GA:       316     (complementary to (converted) bottom strand)  
	CT/GA/GA:       2725    ((converted) bottom strand)  
	
- [padded genome](https://github.com/FelixKrueger/Bismark/issues/94)
	- strigg/analyses/20181025/slurm-401715.out shows > 1M errors: 'Chromosomal sequence could not be extracted'
	- creating padded genome to see if this improves mapping
	- Steven can run scripts from coenv :
	sbatch -p coenv -A coenv 20181101_bmrkPgenrGenmPadded.sh

- tested effects of directional mapping and genome padding on mapping efficiency with one sample (103)
	- [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/shellytrigg/Shelly_Pgenerosa/blob/master/analyses/Geoduck_OA_mapping_quality.ipynb)
	- mapping reports to compare:

### CONCLUSION: 
- **DIRECTIONAL MAPPING AND PADDED GENOME LED TO SLIGHTLY LOWER MAPPING EFFICIENCY**
- **PADDED GENOME DID NOT IMPROVE THE NUMBER OF SEQUENCES THAT COULD BE EXTRACTED**
