## Oyster (C. gigas) seed proteomics

- Worked on Proteomics stuff, met with Steven and talked about important things to include in the paper	
	- [draft](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oVgqsODHQFkRwsxuzcv_k-px6AaQ8Dg1w2x5XMOMmMI/edit?usp=sharing)
	- [github readme](https://github.com/kaitlynrm/OysterSeedProject/blob/master/README.md)
	- for results section:
		- come up with a basic description of proteins (e.g. mapped vs. unmapped, commonly expressed, unique to one silo)
			- [github issue](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/472)
		- describe those expressed through development
			- hierarchical clustering
			- ASCA
			- Random Forest
			- Venn diagram of proteins selected by stat. methods
			- Pathway analysis:
				- GO 
				- KEGG
				- Reactome
	- need to meet with Kaitlyn about this Thursday

	- waiting until thursday to collect hemolymph because ran out of time
	- For sampling: bring syrine, tubes, ice, paper towel, gloves
	- spin samples @ 1000xg @4C for 10min
	- freeze at -80C

## FSH 546
Web interface tools for doing sequence alignments and analysis:

- CoGe (web-based analysis instead of command line)
- CyVerse
