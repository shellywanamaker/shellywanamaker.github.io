## Broodstock experiment

### need to:
- order KCl 3M 25mL pH probe storage solution, Mettler Toledo, # 51343180
- order CRMs (only 1 unopened bottle left)
- bring extension cord and power strip for adding pumps to tanks 3 and 4
![tank setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shellywanamaker/P_generosa/master/img/IMG_20181030_TANKS.jpg)  
- bring materials to label ducks (nail polish? superglue + labels?)
- something to fix probes in tanks?

### setup status 
- CO2 gas gauge

- tank 2 pH probe 3 placement may have been too close to the inflow

### Monitoring water chemistry in OA treatments
- brought waste container and DI water back to Pt. Whitney

- using the titrator
	[follow this protocol](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hputnam/Geoduck_Conditioning/master/Protocols/20180820_Roberts_Titrator_Protocol_(PT_WHITNEY))

	- will take video next time I run it. 
	- did about 5 flushes with flicking
	- ran pH calibration with pH standards
	- ran CRMs
	- ran samples
		- used measuring cups to sample the water, poured it immediately into glass bottles
	- [TA calculation script](https://github.com/hputnam/project_juvenile_geoduck_OA/blob/master/RAnalysis/Scripts/TotalAlkCalc_wParsing.R)

	-figure out how to download data from Apex Fusion
